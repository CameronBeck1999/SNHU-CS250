"How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?"

The way that I would interpret user needs, as a member of the scrum team, is by asking both the Product Owner and the Scrum Master the specific details so that me and the rest of the team can have clarification on the direction we must go for the product. The Product Owner provides the details to the Scrum Master and the Scrum Master informs the team on the set expectations and goals to implement towards the project. Creating user stories help out in the long run because the user stories identify every piece of important information of the stakeholders' needs for the product owner to gather so that the rest of the Scrum team gets clued in on the expectations so they know exactly what to do.

"How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?"

I want to approach developing programs with the use of the Agile method. The Agile method is a good tool to use to be flexibile and adjust to any changes that may come to software development. It's also helpful when it comes to the clients needs, project planning with the use of Scrum Events, and testing to see if the development meets the mark for send off to the client.

"What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?"

What it means to be a good team member in software development is the willingness to work with others. When put into teams, communication and collaborating are the way to go especially since the team is responsible for one aspect of the development. With these in mind, it can help the project by making sure everybody is fufilling their end of the bargin and nobody is left behind. Also, it goes without saying that listening to your teammates is just as important because it's apart of communication and you have to be open to possible ideas, even if it doesn't sound favorable to you. That's why Scrum Teams are important so each member can help express their point of view on their ideas and see if the team, as a whole, agrees altogether or not.
